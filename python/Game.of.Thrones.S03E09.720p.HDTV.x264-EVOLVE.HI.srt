1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,694
<i>You think I can't hear you</i>
<i>every day talking about visions</i>

2
00:00:03,728 --> 00:00:05,662
<i>and three-eyed ravens</i>
<i>and black magic?</i>

3
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:07,997
I don't want you talking to him till
we get to Castle Black.

4
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:10,700
We're not going to Castle Black.
Jon Snow isn't there.

5
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:12,495
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

6
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:14,171
Oh, no, I'm not
going back there.

7
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:17,341
I promised your maester I'd get you
to Castle Black and no further.

8
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,944
You won't win. You don't
have the discipline.

9
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,113
- You don't know how to fight together.
- You don't know that.

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,816
If you attack the Wall
you'll die, all of you.

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,584
All of <i>us.</i>

12
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:29,054
I can't force them
to meet us in the field.

13
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:32,524
- Casterly Rock can't run away.
- Can you do it?

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,393
There is only one person
in this kingdom

15
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:36,963
with that kind of army.
Walder Frey.

16
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:39,866
We will do whatever we can to
give Lord Frey what he needs.

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,369
Our father requires Lord Edmure
to wed one of his daughters.

18
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:46,072
- You were sent here to kill me?
- I don't want to.

19
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:48,107
What do your captains
have to say about that?

20
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:50,777
Daario:
<i>You should ask them.</i>

21
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:53,146
Will you fight for me?

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,216
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,285
My sword is yours,
my life is yours,

24
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:00,053
my heart is yours.

25
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:03,624
- Is that the Blackwater?
- Where do you think I'm taking you?

26
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:06,193
- Back to King's Landing.
- That's the Red Fork.

27
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:07,728
I'm taking you
to the Twins.

28
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:10,397
Your uncle's marrying
one of the Frey girls.

29
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:12,566
Your mother and brother
will be there

30
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:14,535
and they'll pay me for you.

31
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,838
That rain will cost
us another day.

32
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:19,474
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

33
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:22,143
- He's getting the wedding he wanted.
- He's getting a wedding.

34
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:24,146
<i>It was a king he wanted.</i>

35
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:26,581
It's come for the baby.

36
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:27,883
You stay back!

37
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:32,454
- ( grunts )
- No, you can't have him.

38
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,223
- <i>No!</i>

No.

49

It's dangerous.

50
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,206
If we take Tywin's
castle from him,

51
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:05,509
the lords of Westeros will
realize he's not invincible.

52

Take his home,

Why are you telling me?

55
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:16,820
You begged me
not to send Theon

56
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:20,758
to negotiate with his father
and I ignored your advice.

57
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,096
Now Winterfell is burnt
to the ground,

58

the North is overrun
with ironborn,

and Bran and Rickon
are gone.

60
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,804
So Casterly Rock...

61
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:40,110
I'm asking your advice.

62
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:48,385
We have enough men?

63
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,225
If Walder Frey cooperates.

64
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,228

cooperates.

<i>before we take</i>
<i>the castle...</i>

67
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:13,043
we'll be caught between
Tywin's army and the sea.

68
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:20,816
We'll lose the war and die
the way Father died.

69
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,851
Or worse.

70
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:31,693
Show them how it feels
to lose what they love.

71
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,492
Walder:
<i>My honored guests...</i>

We thank you for your
hospitality, my lord.

77
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:28,484
I have come to make
my apologies, my lord,

78
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,386
and to beg
your forgiveness.

79
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,789
Don't beg my forgiveness,
Your Grace.

80
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:38,327
It wasn't me you spurned.
It was my girls.

<i>One of them was supposed</i>

Now none of them are.

83
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:59,781
This is Arwyen
my daughter.

84
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:04,419
<i>My daughter Walda,</i>
<i>my daughter Derwa,</i>

<i>Ginia and Neila.</i>

88

<i>Serra and Sarra,</i>
<i>granddaughters, twins.</i>

89
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:24,772
You could have
had either.

90
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:28,076
<i>Could have had both</i>
<i>for all I care.</i>

91
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,544
My granddaughter
Marianne.

92
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:33,447
<i>My granddaughter Freya.</i>

93
00:07:34,883 --> 00:07:37,284

Wertha.

<i>Waldra.</i>

Waldina.

- I'm Merry.
- Fine.

98
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,899
And here's my youngest
daughter Shirei,

99
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:55,870
<i>though she hasn't</i>
<i>bled yet.</i>

100
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:58,773
Clearly you don't have
the patience for all that.

101
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,776
My ladies.

102
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,313
All men should keep their
word, kings most of all.

103
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:09,884
I was pledged to marry one
of you and I broke that vow.

104
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,086
<i>The fault</i>
<i>is not with you.</i>

105
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:15,523
<i>Any man would be lucky</i>
<i>to have any one of you.</i>

106
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:18,459
<i>I did what I did</i>
<i>not to slight you,</i>

107
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:20,328
but because I loved another.

108
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:22,263
<i>I know these words</i>
<i>cannot set right</i>

109
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,331
<i>the wrong I have done</i>
<i>to you and your house.</i>

110
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:27,668
I beg your forgiveness

111
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:30,804
and pledge to do
all I can to make amends

112
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:33,674
so the Freys of the Crossing
and the Starks of Winterfell

113
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:35,642
may once again be friends.

114
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:44,852
Walder:
<i>Very good.</i>

115
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:48,989
There she is.

116
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:51,158
<i>Come closer.</i>

117
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:53,159
Let me have a look at you.

118
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,301
Still can't see you.

119
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:04,470
Old eyes.

120
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:21,355
Love.

121
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:25,260
<i>That's what the Starks</i>
<i>of Winterfell call it, eh?</i>

122
00:09:25,294 --> 00:09:27,328
( chuckles )

123
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:29,397
Very honorable.

124
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,699
I call it a pretty face.

125
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:34,803
Mmm, very pretty.

126
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:39,007
Prettier than this lot,
that's for sure.

127
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:42,611
Very shapely as well.

128
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:47,316
<i>Oh, you try to hide her</i>
<i>under that dress.</i>

129
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,318
If you wanted to hide her,

130
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:51,721
you shouldn't have brought her
here in the first place.

131
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:59,396
I can always see

132
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,265
what's going on
beneath a dress.

133
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,202
<i>Been at this a long time.</i>

134
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,105
<i>I bet when you take</i>
<i>that dress off,</i>

135
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,841
everything stays
right where it is.

136
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,675
Doesn't drop an inch.

137
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:19,213
Your king says he betrayed
me for love.

138
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:21,983
I say he betrayed me
for firm tits

139
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:24,619
and a tight fit.

140
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:27,321
And I can respect that.

141
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,359
When I was your age,
I'd have broken 50 oaths

142
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:35,828
to get into that
without a second thought.

143
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:42,635
Well, I've enough room
in the hall for you lot.

144
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,737
We'll set up
tents outside

145
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:47,140
with food and ale
for the rest of your men.

146
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:49,342
Thank you, my lord.

147
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:54,181
Well, let's get ready.

148
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:56,250
The wine will flow red

149
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:59,754
<i>and the music</i>
<i>will play loud</i>

150
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:03,992

this mess behind us.

151

- <i>( horse neighs )</i>
- <i>( weapons clang )</i>

152
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:14,702
Where?

153
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:16,337
There.

154
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:26,314
There.
It's a back gate.

155
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:29,250
My men use it when they
visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

156
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:30,986
Your men,
but not you?

157
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,654
Daario: <i>I have no interest</i>
<i>in slaves.</i>

158
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,957
A man cannot make love
to property.

159
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:39,862
This is where
we enter the city.

160
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,364
Very few guards.
They know me.

161
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:42,899
They let me inside--

162
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:45,168
We're not gonna sneak
an army through a back gate.

163
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:48,172
I kill the guards.
I take your two best men

164
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:51,575
and lead them through the back
streets, which I know well,

165
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,710
and open the front gates.

166
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:55,345
Then comes the army.

167
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:58,014
Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.

168
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,952
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey
Worm and me to the slaughter,

169
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,454
cutting the head
off our army.

170
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,224
<i>The masters of Yunkai</i>
<i>will pay you your fee</i>

171
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,626
and you won't have
to split it three ways

172
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,661
'cause you've already
slaughtered your partners.

173
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,164
You have
a very suspicious mind.

174
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,267
In my experience, only dishonest
people think this way.

175
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,638
You command the Unsullied.

176
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,041
<i>What do you think?</i>

177
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,643
<i>( Daenerys speaking</i>
<i>Valyrian )</i>

178
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,021
You leave tonight.

179
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,156
Very good.

180
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,991
We'll prepare.

181
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:46,697
Ser Jorah.

182
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,401
You can use
an extra sword.

183
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,937
You're the Queensguard,
Ser Barristan.

184
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,006
Your place
is by the queen.

185
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,475
If we are truly
her loyal servants,

186
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,544
we'll do whatever
needs to be done

187
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,715
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

188
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,288
We're west
of Castle Black,

189
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,323
but the Nightfort's
closest to us.

190
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,493
It was the first
castle on the Wall.

191
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,929
The Watch abandoned it during
the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

192
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,633
Too big.
Impossible to maintain.

193
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,002
Other than
Castle Black itself,

194
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,504
the Nightfort's
the perfect castle for us.

195
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,008
It's got a secret
sally port,

196
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,644
the Black Gate,
as old as the Wall itself.

197
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,414
No one's used it
in centuries most likely.

198
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,116
It leads through the Wall

199
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,051
right down
into the Nightfort,

200
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,953
if one knows
how to find it,

201
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,889
which, it just
so happens, I do.

202
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:53,229
How do you know
all that?

203
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:57,200
I read about it
in a very old book.

204
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:04,273
You know all that

205
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:07,242
from staring
at marks on paper?

206
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:10,312
Yes.

207
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,115
You're like a wizard.

208
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:30,301
Our father
used to tell us

209
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:34,706
that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.

210
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,242
Here we are.

211
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,612
Alive.

212
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,918
<i>( donkey braying )</i>

213
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,630
Remember what happens
to children who run.

214
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,500
I'm your father
and I'll do the talking.

215
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,746
The roads have gone
right to hell, haven't they?

216
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,915
Cracked three spokes
this morning.

217
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,951
- Need a hand?
- Need about eight hands.

218
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,919
Oh!

219
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,121
Got to get this
salt pork to the Twins

220
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:24,757
in time for the wedding.

221
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:27,293
Many thanks.

222
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,030
Don't!

223
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,365
Don't kill him.

224
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,567
Dead rats don't squeak.

225
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,269
You're so dangerous,
aren't you?

226
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,337
Saying scary things
to little girls.

227
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:41,140
Killing little boys
and old people.

228
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,608
A real hard man you are.

229
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,610
More than anyone
you know.

230
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,379
You're wrong.
I know a killer.

231
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,049
- A real killer.
- That so?

232
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,684
You'd be like
a kitten to him.

233
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,053
He'd kill you
with his little finger.

234
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,188
That him?

235
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,591
- No.
- Good.

236
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,561
Don't kill him.

237
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,863
Please.

238
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,032
Please don't.

239
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,736
You're very kind.

240
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,738
Someday it'll
get you killed.

241
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,207
( groaning )

242
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,246
( grunts )

243
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,924
Where are we?

244
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,159
The Gift, I think.

245
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,828
Brandon the Builder
gave all this land

246
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,930
<i>south of the Wall</i>
<i>to the Night's Watch</i>

247
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,900
for their sustenance
and support.

248
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,203
Maester Luwin
taught me that.

249
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,274
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

250
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:52,011
It's good land
and there's no war up here.

251
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,546
Why leave?

252
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,281
Wildlings.

253
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,049
Sorry.

254
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,785
But they come over
the Wall and raid,

255
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,653
steal, carry off women.

256
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,888
Old Nan said they turn
your skull into a cup

257
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,990
and make you drink
your own blood from it.

258
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,361
That's what Old Nan said.

259
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,063
There's a storm coming.

260
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,733
- I don't see any--
- <i>( thunder rolling )</i>

261
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:20,938
It's as good a place
to shelter as any.

262
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,544
We can drink some blood
while we wait.

263
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,712
I don't need much.

264
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,515
( screeching )

265
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,961
Only one old man
and eight good horses.

266
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,097
What's one old man
doing with eight horses?

267
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,998
He breeds them
for the Watch.

268
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,001
How's he keep folks
from stealing them?

269
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,370
The Watch protects him.

270
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,639
Not today they don't.

271
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,343
He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.

272
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,579
- Tormund: <i>And proper steel.</i>
- Let's carve him up.

273
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:01,981
We just take
the horses and go.

274
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,684
The old man's no threat.

275
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,153
I keep telling you.

276
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,322
He's an old man.

277
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,824
A spear through the heart's
a better way to die

278
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:14,372
than coughing up your last with
no one but your horses to hear.

279
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:19,198
The Watch might send a few men
looking for a horse thief.

280
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:22,101
They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.

281
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:23,970
I hope so.

282
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,940
Killing crows
in their castle is tough.

283
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,909
Killing them out here
in the open,

284
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,644
that's what we do.

285
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,412
Spread out.

286
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,015
Surround the hut
and move in.

287
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,975
- ( sword clangs )
- ( snorts )

288
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:04,478
( neighing )

289
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,025
Ygritte!

290
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,596
Man:
<i>Clear the barn!</i>

291
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:04,169
No one's going to believe you're a
hog farmer if you eat them all.

292
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,505
Best part of the animal.

293
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:13,413
Don't worry.
They're still there.

294
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:16,250
I know
they're still there.

295
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:18,018
You check
every five minutes

296
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:20,620
like you're afraid
they're gonna move.

297
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:22,422
I'm not afraid.

298
00:20:22,457 --> 00:20:24,691
Of course you are.

299
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:27,027
You're almost there

300
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,663
and you're afraid
you won't make it.

301
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:33,100
The closer you get,
the worse the fear gets.

302
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:36,571
No point in trying to hide
behind that face.

303
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:39,507
<i>I know fear</i>
<i>when I see it.</i>

304
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,409
Seen it a lot.

305
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:45,246
I knew fear
when I saw it in you.

306
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:49,518
You're afraid of fire.

307
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:51,287
When Beric's sword
went up in flames,

308
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:53,155
you looked like
a scared little girl.

309
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:59,128
And I know why, too.

310
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,433
<i>I heard what</i>
<i>your brother did to you.</i>

311
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:05,869
Pressed your face
to the fire

312
00:21:05,937 --> 00:21:08,505
like you're a nice
juicy mutton chop.

313
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,478
That give you some ideas?

314
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:19,984
Might do.

315
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:22,353
Go ahead, then.

316
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:24,755
You might get away.

317
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,325
Might even make it
there on your own.

318
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:30,628
They're just over
the river.

319
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:32,797
The closest you've
been to family

320
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:35,866
since Ilyn Payne
snipped your daddy's neck.

321
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:42,306
Someday I'm gonna put
a sword through your eye

322
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,974
and out the back
of your skull.

323
00:21:55,987 --> 00:21:57,654
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

324
00:21:57,688 --> 00:22:00,456
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

325
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:12,133
How are we going
to get past the Wall?

326
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:14,102
My uncle said
it's 700 feet high.

327
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,772
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

328
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:21,009
How did you get past it?

329
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:27,782
Got in a boat and rowed
past the Bay of Seals.

330
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:31,018
It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.

331
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:33,187
Some climb
straight up the ice.

332
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:36,523
Even Hodor's not strong enough to
climb the Wall with me on his back.

333
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:39,760
Hodor.

334
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:42,329
- 19 castles guard the Wall.
- <i>( thunder booms )</i>

335
00:22:42,364 --> 00:22:45,733
- Only three are still manned.
- Hodor!

336
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:48,002
One of those abandoned fortresses
will give us a way through.

337
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,271
My uncle said the gates were
sealed with ice and stone

338
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:51,739
when the castles
were deserted.

339
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:55,076
Well, we'll have
to open them up again.

340
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,645
<i>( hoofbeats, horse neighs )</i>

341
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,414
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Meera: <i>There's a rider out there.</i>

342
00:23:00,717 --> 00:23:02,651
- Just one?
- <i>( thunder crashes )</i>

343
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:04,453
- Meera: <i>There's more.</i>
- Hodor!

344
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:05,787
<i>( horses neighing )</i>

345
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:07,322
Shh. Shh.

346
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:10,092
- It's just thunder, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

347
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,494
Man:
I yield.

348
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:14,196
- <i>I yield.</i>
- Wildlings.

349
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:16,866
<i>( men shouting )</i>

350
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:20,804
Where's Shaggydog
and Summer?

351
00:23:20,838 --> 00:23:22,839
- Hunting.
- <i>( horses neighing )</i>

352
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:24,875
- <i>( thunder crashes )</i>
- Hodor!

353
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:27,210
- Shh, quiet, Hodor.
- Hodor!

354
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:29,245
Make him shut up.
If they hear us...

355
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,448
- Hush, Hodor. No-- no more Hodoring.
- Hodor!

356
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:34,384
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

357
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:35,752
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.

358
00:23:35,787 --> 00:23:37,954
- <i>( Hodor shouting )</i>
- Bran: <i>Hodor, be quiet.</i>

359
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:39,523
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

360
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:41,625
- Ah! Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

361
00:23:41,693 --> 00:23:44,661
- Hodor! Hodor!
- Hodor, be quiet!

362
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,618
What did you do?

363
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:11,387
Nothing.

364
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:13,356
I don't know.

365
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,424
<i>( horse screaming )</i>

366
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,062
What's that?

367
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:22,566
That's a horse dying.

368
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:35,211
Man:
<i>Bring them over here.</i>

369
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:38,414
Man #2: <i>That was the last of them.</i>
<i>The rest are dead.</i>

370
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:40,682
Orell:
<i>I heard shouting up there.</i>

371
00:24:40,717 --> 00:24:42,851
Thunder.

372
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:45,453
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

373
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:48,622
Maybe it's ghosts.
( laughs )

374
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:53,460
( eagle screeching )

375
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:00,868
That won't
help you, grandpa.

376
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,907
Where you riding?

377
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:08,942
Doesn't matter now,
does it?

378
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:11,712
No, it doesn't
matter now.

379
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:16,817
Cut his throat or he'll
tell the crows we're here.

380
00:25:22,724 --> 00:25:24,458
You understand.

381
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:26,460
Let me stand at least.

382
00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:29,897
<i>Let me go</i>
<i>with a bit of dignity.</i>

383
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:36,637
Make the crow kill him.

384
00:25:40,175 --> 00:25:43,578
You're one of us now.
Prove it.

385
00:25:47,784 --> 00:25:50,386
The wolves are out there.

386
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,024
I can't do it by choice.

387
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:59,096
I don't know how.
It happens in my dreams.

388
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,232
You're a warg, Bran.

389
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,334
It's in your blood.

390
00:26:03,368 --> 00:26:04,836
I can't.

391
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,771
You just did with him.

392
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,807
A wolf is nothing
compared to that.

393
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:18,249
She looks sharp.

394
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:23,488
( muttering prayer )

395
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,929
Do it.

396
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:32,398
Do it.

397
00:26:32,432 --> 00:26:35,567
I told you.
He's still one of them.

398
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,337
Go on, boy.

399
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:43,541
Go on!

400
00:26:50,449 --> 00:26:52,283
( groans )

401
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:54,118
He's a crow.

402
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:56,086
<i>He'll always be a crow.</i>

403
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:58,488
And here's his crow wife
guarding him.

404
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:01,725
He'll stab us in the back
first chance he gets.

405
00:27:04,662 --> 00:27:07,030
- Kill him.
- ( Jon shouts )

406
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:22,279
( screaming )

407
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:24,348
- He's one of them.
- No!

408
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:25,882
Do you hear me?

409
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,518
( screams )

410
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,192
You're not gonna die
for one of them.

411
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:39,497
Do it.

412
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:41,365
They'll find us
if you don't.

413
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,302
<i>( swords clanging )</i>

414
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:51,410
( breathing heavily )

415
00:27:51,444 --> 00:27:53,612
( growling )

416
00:28:01,622 --> 00:28:03,189
( Orell shouts )

417
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,031
( gasps )

418
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,033
You were right
the whole time.

419
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,701
( gasps )

420
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,636

421
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:25,677
( Jon screaming )

422
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:40,592
Hyah!

423
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:02,281
Daario: <i>When you hear a songbird's</i>
<i>whistle, you come.</i>

424
00:29:02,315 --> 00:29:06,085
I'm a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.

425
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:14,059
- ( guard shouts in Valyrian )
- Daario Naharis.

426
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:31,077
<i>( whistling )</i>

427
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:44,322
Daario:
<i>That one was quick.</i>

428
00:29:47,092 --> 00:29:49,126
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.

429
00:29:49,161 --> 00:29:52,029
The Yunkish prefer to let their
slaves do their fighting for them.

430
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:54,031
( guards shouting )

431
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:39,946
That's what you call
a few guards?

432
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,186
( guards shouting )

433
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:55,930
<i>( men shouting )</i>

434
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:06,340
Come on!
What do you got, huh?

435
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,211
( cheering )

436
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:23,115
Lord Edmure...

437
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:27,053
I hope I'm not
a disappointment to you.

438
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:28,688
( chuckles )

439
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:38,065
You're a delight
to me, my lady.

440
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:41,369
You may now cloak
the bride

441
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,471
and bring her under
your protection.

442
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:14,135
In the sight of the Seven,

443
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,839
I hereby seal
these two souls,

444
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:21,476
binding them as one
for eternity.

445
00:33:21,511 --> 00:33:24,446
<i>Look upon each other</i>
<i>and say the words.</i>

446
00:33:27,016 --> 00:33:29,284
Both:
Father, Smith,

447
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:31,686
Warrior, Mother,

448
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:34,757
Maiden, Crone,
Stranger...

449
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:36,892
- I am hers...
- I am his...

450
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:39,061
- <i>and she is mine...</i>
- <i>and he is mine...</i>

451
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:43,099
Both: <i>...from this day</i>
<i>until the end of my days.</i>

452
00:33:47,805 --> 00:33:50,674
- Is that safe?
- They're long gone.

453
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:57,646
You were right.

454
00:33:57,714 --> 00:34:00,215
I can get inside Summer's
mind whenever I want.

455
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:02,450
Of course you can.

456
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,052
North of the Wall
there are wildlings

457
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:08,088
who can control
all sorts of animals.

458
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:10,457
<i>But you did a lot</i>
<i>more than that.</i>

459
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,362
You got inside
Hodor's mind.

460
00:34:15,396 --> 00:34:18,231
They can't do that
north of the Wall?

461
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:22,670
No one can do that...

462
00:34:22,704 --> 00:34:23,805
<i>anywhere.</i>

463
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:33,114
When I was looking
through Summer's eyes,

464
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:34,815
- I saw Jon.
- Where?

465
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,617
He was with the wildlings.

466
00:34:36,651 --> 00:34:38,686
They tried to kill him,
but he got away.

467
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,354
Osha: <i>He'll be heading back</i>
<i>to Castle Black, then.</i>

468
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,223
That's where we should go.

469
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:44,625
For all we know, Castle
Black's already under attack.

470
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,461
- If this many wildlings got through--
- I already told you.

471
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:49,497
I'm not going
north of the Wall.

472
00:34:49,531 --> 00:34:52,500
Everything Jojen
told me is true.

473
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:56,704
You saw what I did
to Hodor.

474
00:34:56,738 --> 00:34:58,706
<i>I have to find</i>
<i>the three-eyed raven.</i>

475
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,308
Listen to me,
little lord.

476
00:35:00,342 --> 00:35:01,575
Don't worry.

477
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:04,712
I'm not asking you
to come with me.

478
00:35:06,649 --> 00:35:08,416
It won't be safe
for Rickon.

479
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:11,520
Me?
I'm coming with you.

480
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:14,056
No.

481
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,725
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

482
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,962
The Umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.

483
00:35:19,997 --> 00:35:21,731
I'm coming with you.

484
00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:23,633
I'm your brother.

485
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,969
I have to protect you.

486
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,207
Right now I have
to protect you.

487
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:34,377
Robb's at war and I'm
going beyond the Wall.

488
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:36,780
If something
happens to us,

489
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:38,882
you're the heir
to Winterfell.

490
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:43,120
Would you know how
to find the Last Hearth?

491
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:46,257
You southerners build your big
castles and you never move.

492
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,925
You're easy to find.

493
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:50,695
We're not southerners.

494
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:53,798
And I don't want
to leave you.

495
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:56,634
Shh, shh.
Come here, little soldier.

496
00:35:58,103 --> 00:36:01,706
You and me, we're gonna
have some adventures.

497
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:04,109
You don't have to do
any of this.

498
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:05,410
( crying )

499
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:06,911
Your family
took me in

500
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:09,281
and was good to me when
they had no cause to be.

501
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:11,650
<i>Shh.</i>

502
00:36:11,684 --> 00:36:13,952
We'll be fine,
you and me.

503
00:36:13,986 --> 00:36:16,221
The Umbers
are great warriors.

504
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:18,890
Even I heard
about them growing up.

505
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:21,293
They'll teach you
how to swing a sword.

506
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:24,863
I know how
to swing a sword.

507
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:29,634
( kisses )

508
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,539
You're leaving now?
It's the middle of the night.

509
00:36:34,573 --> 00:36:36,441
I learned to walk
in darkness.

510
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:40,612
Say your good-byes,
little man.

511
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:50,788
Keep this one safe.

512
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:54,624
He means
the world to me.

513
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:18,249
We've been waiting
a long time.

514
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:22,287
Haven't we?

515
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:25,223
I don't know,
you tell me.

516
00:37:25,258 --> 00:37:27,459
How long does it take
to sack a city?

517
00:37:35,701 --> 00:37:37,802
It was just as you said.

518
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:41,238
They did not believe
until it was too late.

519
00:37:41,272 --> 00:37:43,273
Their slave soldiers

520
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:46,777
threw down their spears
and surrendered.

521
00:37:50,881 --> 00:37:53,450
And Daario Naharis?

522
00:37:57,622 --> 00:38:01,058
<i>( footsteps )</i>

523
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:16,575

They're good,

527
00:38:41,268 --> 00:38:43,002
They ought to be

- ( Catelyn laughs )

531
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,052
He complained
about this marriage

532
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,321
the entire ride
from Riverrun,

533

<i>and now look at him.</i>

534

Blackfish: <i>The gods love</i>
<i>to reward a fool.</i>

535
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:07,393
- Uncle.
- What?

536
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:10,396
He's my nephew.
I love him.

537
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,432
And he's a damned fool.

538
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:14,834
( chuckles )

539
00:39:17,804 --> 00:39:20,206
Don't you drink,
Lord Bolton?

540
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,542
Never do, my lady.
Dulls the senses.

541
00:39:22,576 --> 00:39:24,811
That's the point.

542
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,646
Didn't you marry
one of these Frey girls?

543
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,148
Aye.

544
00:39:28,182 --> 00:39:30,250
Lord Walder let me choose
any of his granddaughters

545
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,387
and promised me the girl's
weight in silver as a dowry.

546
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,256
So I have
a fat young bride.

547
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,258
( laughs )

548
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,260
I hope she makes you
very happy.

549
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,095
Well, she's made me
very rich.

550
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:44,765
Pardon, my lord,
my lady.

551
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,267
I need to find
a tree to piss on.

552
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,672
My mother's alone
with Roose Bolton.

553
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:53,140
I should rescue her.

554
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:55,108
Your mother is less
in need of rescue

555
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,110
than any woman
I've ever met.

556
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,212
Be kind.

557
00:39:58,246 --> 00:40:00,247
She's finally starting
to like you.

558
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,717
And I like her.

559
00:40:03,752 --> 00:40:06,954
But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis

560
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,257
playing my harp and you
would be sitting over there

<i>out of Roslin Frey's hand.</i>

a terrible mistake.

( scoffs )

564
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,302
Striking your king

No, don't.

566
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:28,977
Don't insult them.

567

00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:51,364
has wrapped my daughter

But they are not yet
man and wife.

Every bride

I'm sure you endured
yours with grace.

594

Oh, Ned forbade it.

595
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:26,483
He said it wouldn't be right

That is a very
strange custom.

599
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,111
I suppose it does
seem strange

600
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:43,812
from a foreigner's
perspective.

601
00:42:43,847 --> 00:42:45,648
It seems normal
to you?

602
00:42:45,715 --> 00:42:48,084
It's a tradition.

603
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,788
Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

604
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:55,358
the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

605

But there are other ways
of providing proof.

606
00:43:01,098 --> 00:43:02,865
Boy or girl?

607
00:43:05,236 --> 00:43:06,937
I don't know.

608
00:43:06,971 --> 00:43:10,140
But if it's a boy, I know
what we should name him.

Oh, do you?

610

It seems to me the father

611
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:15,789
should have some say in
his son's naming.

612

Eddard.
